<h3>We need data mining.</h3>

We need data mining to run the business better. Data mining is a process of discovering hidden information from data using a broad range of techniques (we will discuss those later). This might sound hard, but see the following examples:

Amazon suggesting for things that a user might also like, Gmail recognizing some emails as spam, and YouTube Music playing songs that a user might prefer for the next playlist are good examples of data mining. Again, it's a process of <b>discovering HIDDEN INFORMATION from data</b>. We use the information we already know to get information that we want to predict. The ability to formulate a real-world problem into classic data mining problems is critical.

There are a few types of problems in data: classification, regression, clustering, co-occurrence grouping, and data reduction. Here are simple definitions of those:
1. classification: predicting a categorical target (Male/Female)
2. regression: prediction of a numeric target (sales)
3. clustering: grouping by similarity
4. co-occurrence grouping: finding associations
5. data reduction: replacing a large data with a smaller set
