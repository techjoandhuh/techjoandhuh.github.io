<h3>We use train data to build models for test data.</h3>

Suppose your friend is applying to a MS program in the MA program. He asks you to evaluate his chance of success. How can you help him to predict whether he will get accepted?

You need not just positive examples who got accepted to the program, but you also need negative examples in order to understand the bar of admission to the BA program. The more examples/data you see, the better you become at providing an accurate prediction for your friend.

To test your accuracy, your friend gave you the application materials of his two cousins and three roommates who have applied in 2021 and ask you to "predict" whether they were admitted. The five were not included in the people you talked to before. The more people your friend tested you with, the more reliable estimation of your accuracy will be obtained!

So, here are two definitions for training and testing:
1. training: using historical data to obtain a model, which can produce an output (prediction Y from the input X)
2. testing: applying the model to unseen cases, in order to evaluate the model
