<h3>Welcome to <b>Algorithm</b> course!</h3><br>
In this course, you will learn what algorithm is and design and implement basic algorithm! Let's have fun learning algorithm!<br><br>

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.
