<h3>Welcome to <b>Data Mining</b> course!</h3><br>
In this course, you will learn what data mining is and have ability to actually do data mining through N chapters! (Aren't you looking forward to it? 🤪) Let's have fun learning data!<br><br>

Data is everywhere. You've probably heard about data quite a lot, and, yes, we are exposed to data tons of times a day.
"More than 835,000 Covid-19 deaths have been reported in the United States in total", 
"There have been more than 305 million cases and more than 5.4 million deaths globally.", "데이터 관련 내용 하나 더" (COVID-19 Pandemic, NYT)
Don't these sound familiar? Yes, this is what data is. Super easy!
